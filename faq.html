    <button class="faq-question">Why should I donate blood?
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The answer is simple – You could save up to 3 people’s lives! Blood can only be given from one person to another – there is no other source! Volunteer blood donors are needed daily to give blood for the thousands of patients who need it. Less than 5% of the eligible population donates. However, more than 90% of the population will need blood in their lifetime. </p>
